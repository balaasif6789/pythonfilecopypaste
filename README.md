# pythonfilecopypaste
A Python file to copy paste files. I used it to automate sorting of reports based on the groups which they belonged to. 

I have included a sample excel file. The 0th column is the list of file names. The 1st column is the folders in which these files have to be copied. 

TODO:
1 accept file name from cmdline
2. Convert it to exe
